# KittenTTS Benchmark App

A React Native app for deterministic `@kittentts/react-native` cloud-device benchmarks.

This app is copied from the bare React Native example but adds a benchmark-only
screen surface for CI. Keep normal sample-app changes in `examples/BareRNExample`;
keep TestMu/Appium benchmark changes here.

The benchmark app declares `onnxruntime-react-native` directly so React Native
autolinking sees the native ONNX dependency when CI installs the SDK from a local
`.tgz` package instead of npm.

The native iOS target and Android package still use the original React Native
template names (`BasicExample` / `BareRNExample`) to keep the copied native
projects stable.

## Features

- Model selection (Nano, Nano int8, Micro, Mini)
- Voice selection (8 voices)
- Adjustable speed (0.5x to 2.0x)
- Generate and play speech on-device
- Download progress indicator
- Result card showing audio metadata
- Benchmark report with first-run, best-of-5 warm-run, p50, p95, RTF, sample count, and sample hash values

## Run The Example

Run these commands from the repository root.

Prerequisites:

- Node.js >= 20
- Android Studio with an emulator open for Android
- Xcode with an iOS simulator available for iOS

Android:

```bash
cd benchmark/app
npm install
npm start
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd benchmark/app
npm run android
```

iOS:

```bash
cd benchmark/app
npm install
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
npm start
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd benchmark/app
npm run ios
```

The same commands work on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Keep Metro running while
the app is open. Set `RCT_METRO_PORT=8082` if port `8081` is already in use.
The first run downloads the model files, so keep the simulator/emulator online.

On macOS/Linux, `npm run android:unix` and `npm run ios:unix` are optional
helpers that start Metro automatically.

## Build A Debug APK

The APK will be written under `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
This is a debug APK, so start Metro with `npm start` when testing it.

```bash
cd benchmark/app
npm install
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat assembleDebug` in the `android` folder.

## Troubleshooting

If the app opens with "No script URL provided", Metro is not running on the port
the app expects. Run `npm start` from `benchmark/app`, then reload.

## How It Works

1. On first launch, the app downloads the selected model (~56 MB for Nano)
2. Type any English text in the input field
3. Select a model, voice, and speed
4. Tap **Generate** to synthesise audio (returns metadata without playing)
5. Tap **Speak** to synthesise and play through the device speakers

The model is cached on disk after the first download, so subsequent launches are instant.

## Beginner Implementation Notes

Bare React Native needs an audio player. This example uses
`react-native-sound`:

```typescript
import Sound from 'react-native-sound';
import { KittenTTS, createRNSoundPlayer } from '@kittentts/react-native';

const tts = await KittenTTS.create({
  player: createRNSoundPlayer(Sound),
});
```

Generate only:

```typescript
const result = await tts.generate('Hello from KittenTTS.');
console.log(result.duration, result.wordTimings);
```

Generate and play:

```typescript
await tts.speak('Hello from KittenTTS.');
```

If you need word highlighting, generate first and then play:

```typescript
const result = await tts.generate(text);
await tts.play(result, {
  onPlaybackStart: () => startWordHighlighting(result.wordTimings),
});
```

For a full highlighting UI, see `examples/ExpoWordTimingsExample`.
